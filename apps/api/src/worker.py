"""arq worker — runs migrations out-of-process.

Replaces FastAPI BackgroundTasks for migration jobs. The API enqueues
a job, returns 202, and a separate `arq` process picks it up off
Redis. Key benefits:

  * If the API container restarts mid-run, the job survives — arq
    picks it up again on worker boot.
  * Multiple workers can process independent migrations in parallel
    (one worker per CPU, typically).
  * Retries on transient failures (exponential backoff, 3 attempts
    by default — see `retry` config below).
  * Observable: arq logs each job's lifecycle and failures to stderr;
    production can point those at the same log pipeline as the API.

Run via:
    arq src.worker.WorkerSettings

(See the `worker` service in the top-level docker-compose.yml.)
