"""Keyset pagination query builder.

OFFSET-based paging is fatal at scale: every page repeats the work of
all prior pages. Keyset (a.k.a. seek-method) paging walks the table by
remembering the last row's primary-key tuple and saying "give me the
next N rows after that". Cost stays roughly constant.

This module produces the query *text* for both Oracle and PostgreSQL —
neither is portable enough through SQLAlchemy expression-language for
this case (FETCH FIRST vs LIMIT, tuple-comparison support, identifier
quoting). The runner then feeds the text through `session.execute(text())`.
