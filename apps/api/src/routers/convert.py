"""Public `/convert/{tag}` endpoint — canonical Oracle → Postgres
conversion examples, keyed on construct tag.

This is the "AI conversion preview" lane for the free tier. The
examples are hand-curated and static — fast, deterministic, no token
cost on every page load. Paid tiers get a companion `/convert` POST
that runs Claude against the caller's actual snippet, grounded in the
same examples as few-shot RAG context.

Keeping examples in code (not Markdown files or a DB table) so they
travel with deploys, can be type-checked, and stay close to the tag
enum they key off of. When we add the paid `/convert` POST, its RAG
retrieval will use these same strings as the canonical seed corpus.
