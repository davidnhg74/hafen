"""Opportunistic encryption of existing sensitive columns.

No schema change — the affected columns stay TEXT. What changes is
that the application now writes ciphertext through `EncryptedText`
(see src/services/crypto.py) and reads through a sentinel-prefixed
decrypt step.

This migration walks the existing rows and re-writes each sensitive
value through the encryption layer *if* HAFEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY is
configured at migration time. If no key is configured, the migration
is a no-op — future writes will be plaintext until the operator sets
a key and re-runs via the admin rotation endpoint.

Affected columns:
  * migrations.source_url
  * migrations.target_url
  * instance_settings.anthropic_api_key
  * instance_settings.license_jwt
  * identity_providers.client_secret
